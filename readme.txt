

Hello
I have a Laravel project and I need to add some menus

#1: In this page (https://crm.solutionweb.io/tickets) and (https://crm.solutionweb.io/staffs)
- Some point are missing (http://prntscr.com/plh252)
- Please add a search box to find (fight number, airline, date, Class, Status)

#2: Need to make same as this (http://doorsoft.xyz/demo/irestora_plus/Master/expenseItems)
with this design (http://demo.managemybookings.net/suppliertypes) but don't need this
(http://prntscr.com/peki2y)


#3: Need to make same as this (http://doorsoft.xyz/demo/irestora_plus/Expense/expenses)
 and don't need (http://prntscr.com/pekin2) but here
 (http://prntscr.com/pekiul) need to add an attachement file
PS: Instead "Responsible Person" data should be the data of the staff in this link (https://crm.solutionweb.io/staffs)

#4: Here (http://prntscr.com/plscyi) can you make it as the admin can change the values directly from there

============= Base code credential =============
My project:
https://crm.solutionweb.io/dashboard
login: superadmin
password: superadmin

Sample code:
http://doorsoft.xyz/demo/irestora_plus/Authentication/index.html

Thanks

#2: Here (http://prntscr.com/pm49l0) need to make a new menu call it "Expense Items"
and the page should be similar as (https://crm.solutionweb.io/suppliers)
and we'll try to copy same as this page (http://doorsoft.xyz/demo/irestora_plus/Master/expenseItems) without this (http://prntscr.com/peki2y)
And when we click here (http://prntscr.com/pm4ba5) Should be same as here (http://prntscr.com/pm4boy)
the modal should be as the origina (http://prntscr.com/pm4c02) with this data (http://prntscr.com/pm4c7z)
